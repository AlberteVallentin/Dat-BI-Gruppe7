# Predefined answers to common questions
answers = {
    "What makes a wine 'good quality'?": """
    Wine quality is subjective but generally assessed on several factors:
    
    - **Balance**: No single component (acidity, tannin, alcohol, sweetness) dominates
- **Complexity**: Multiple layers of flavors and aromas that develop over time
    - **Length**: How long the flavors persist after swallowing
    - **Typicity**: How well it represents its grape variety and region
    - **Structure**: The framework of acid, tannin, alcohol that supports the flavors
    - **Intensity**: Concentration and depth of flavor
    
    Professional wine critics often use standardized methods like blind tasting to evaluate quality objectively, though personal preference always plays a role in wine appreciation.
    """,
    
    "How does climate affect wine quality?": """
    Climate is one of the most significant factors affecting wine quality:
    
    - **Cool climate regions** (like Burgundy or Germany) tend to produce wines with higher acidity, lower alcohol, and more delicate flavors
    - **Warm climate regions** (like parts of California or Australia) often produce fuller-bodied wines with higher alcohol, riper fruit flavors, and lower acidity
    - **Diurnal temperature variation** (difference between day and night temperatures) helps develop complexity while preserving acidity
    - **Rainfall timing and amount** affects grape development and can influence harvest decisions
    - **Climate change** is significantly impacting wine regions globally, altering traditional growing patterns and quality parameters
    """,
    
    "What is the role of tannins in wine quality?": """
    Tannins are natural compounds found primarily in red wines that contribute significantly to quality:
    
    - They provide **structure and texture**, creating the drying, astringent sensation felt in the mouth
    - **High-quality tannins** feel smooth and integrated rather than harsh or bitter
    - They contribute to a wine's **aging potential** by acting as natural preservatives
    - They help create **balance** with other components like fruit, acid, and alcohol
    - The **source of tannins** matters: grape skin and seed tannins differ from oak barrel tannins
    - **Tannin management** during winemaking is a critical skill that impacts final wine quality
    """,
    
    "How important is vintage in determining wine quality?": """
    Vintage (the year grapes were harvested) can significantly impact wine quality:
    
    - **Weather conditions** during the growing season affect grape ripeness, flavor development, and overall quality
    - Regions with **variable climates** (like Bordeaux or Burgundy) show more vintage variation than consistent climate regions
    - **Great vintages** occur when weather conditions are optimal throughout the growing season
    - **Challenging vintages** may still produce excellent wines from skilled winemakers
    - Vintage importance varies by **wine style**: it's typically more crucial for age-worthy red wines than for wines meant to be consumed young
    - Understanding vintage conditions helps consumers **set expectations** about a wine's character and quality
    """,
    
    "What does 'balance' mean in wine tasting?": """
    Balance is perhaps the most important indicator of quality in wine:
    
    - It refers to the **harmonious integration** of all components: fruit, acid, tannin, alcohol, and oak
    - In a balanced wine, no single element **overwhelms** the others
    - Different wine styles have different **balance points**: a dessert wine has higher sweetness but is balanced by high acidity
    - **Unbalanced wines** might feel too acidic, too alcoholic, too tannic, or too sweet
    - Balance contributes to a wine's **drinkability** and often its **aging potential**
    - It's often described as a wine feeling "complete" or "harmonious" when tasted
    """,
    
    "How does oak aging affect wine quality?": """
    Oak aging is a traditional technique that can significantly influence wine quality:
    
    - It adds **complexity** through flavors like vanilla, spice, toast, coconut, or smoke
    - It allows **controlled oxidation**, softening the wine's structure over time
    - Oak contributes **tannins** that can enhance structure and aging potential
    - **New oak** imparts stronger flavors than older, previously used barrels
    - **Oak origin** (French, American, etc.) affects the flavor profile
    - **Over-oaking** can mask the wine's inherent character and is considered a quality flaw
    - High-quality wines show **integration** between oak and wine components
    """,
    
    "What's the relationship between price and quality in wine?": """
    The relationship between wine price and quality is complex:
    
    - There's **generally a correlation** between price and quality up to a certain point
    - **Diminishing returns** occur at higher price points, where small quality increases cost much more
    - **Production costs** (vineyard location, harvesting methods, aging requirements) influence price
    - **Scarcity and demand** often drive prices more than objective quality measures
    - **Brand prestige and reputation** can significantly affect price regardless of quality
    - **Value wines** can offer excellent quality-to-price ratios, especially from less famous regions
    - **Blind tasting studies** regularly show that price and perceived quality correlate less than expected

### How to Evaluate Wine Quality Yourself

Follow these steps to assess wine quality like a professional:

1. **Look** at the wine:
   - Check clarity, color depth, and viscosity
   - Tilt the glass to observe color variation from rim to center

2. **Smell** the wine:
   - First impression: initial aromas immediately after pouring
   - Swirl and smell again: releases more complex aromas
   - Identify primary (grape), secondary (fermentation), and tertiary (aging) aromas

3. **Taste** the wine:
   - Take a small sip and "chew" it to spread across your palate
   - Assess sweetness, acidity, tannin, body, and alcohol
   - Note the progression of flavors from initial taste to finish
   - Evaluate balance, complexity, and length

4. **Consider** the context:
   - Is the wine typical of its variety and region?
   - Does it show appropriate development for its age?
   - How does it compare to other wines of similar type?

Remember that practice improves your tasting ability, and keeping notes helps track your observations and preferences.
