# Information about wine quality
st.header("Wine Quality Information")
st.write("""
The quality of wine is influenced by various chemical properties.
Key factors that tend to positively influence wine quality include:

- **Alcohol Content**: Higher alcohol content often correlates with better quality
- **Acidity Balance**: The right balance of fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and citric acid
- **Sulphates**: Moderate levels of sulphates tend to preserve wine better
- **pH**: The proper pH level helps with wine stability and taste

Red and white wines have different characteristics:
* White wines typically have higher residual sugar and sulfur dioxide levels
* Red wines typically have higher fixed acidity and sulphates
